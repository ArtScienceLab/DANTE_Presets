# Default dante presets for the ASIL, Maker space & Pluriversum labs
Default dante presets for the labs.  Several presets are provided. Channel naming provides details to the labs. LTC clock distribution is enabled by default (syncmaster) and should not be changed.


### Best practice for saving custom presets
When saving a dante preset; only select the relevant devices (hold CTRL to select multiple). In the advanced menu, click 'none' and then only select "RX channel subscriptions".  This will allow for faster preset loading.
