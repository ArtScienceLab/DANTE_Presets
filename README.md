# Default dante presets for the ASIL, Maker space & Pluriversum labs
Default dante presets for the labs.  Several presets are provided. Channel naming provides details to the labs. LTC clock distribution is enabled by default (syncmaster) and should not be changed.


### Best practice for saving custom presets
When saving a dante preset; only select the relevant devices (hold CTRL to select multiple). In the advanced menu, click 'none' and then only select "RX channel subscriptions".  This will allow for faster preset loading.


## IPEM_default_june_2020
Starting point for new routings.  Any new setup should probably start from this one.

## IPEM_FACTORY_RESET
Resets ALL IPEM devices to their default state.  This includes naming, ip adresses, latency, clock settings,   labels, etc.  Do not use unless there are networking issues.
